Education 
-------------------

2007 - Universidad de Oviedo
:   *Ph.D. Computer Science*

Dissertation: *Feature Subset Selection in Preference-based Machine Learning Systems*<br/>
Advisors: Antonio Bahamonde Rionda and José R. Quevedo Pérez<br/>
Qualification: Unanimous Summa Cum Laude

My work was focused on studying variable relevancy in machine learning
processes. Specifically, we were working on preference learning, a special kind
of regression where input data is structured as a series of object comparisons.
The goal was to obtain a real-valued function that assigned higher scores to
better objects.

Our goal was to create a prediction model able to discriminate most of the noise
which is often present in problems where input data comes from human sensory
perception. The results of this work were put into practice, and showed
that a fair amount of cost reduction can be made in several industrial
processes.

2001 - Universidad de Oviedo
:   *M.Sc. Computer Science*

During the last term, I was awarded a grant to work at the Artificial
Intelligence Center (University of Oviedo), where I first was exposed to their
research projects in the Machine Learning field. I developed a novel tool
(ML-Lab) providing an unique interface to many machine learning tools, and that
was able to manage pipeline executions over a home-made cluster, thus automating
most of the research and validation processes in the group.

Previous Positions
----------------------

2012 - 2018
: Universidad de Oviedo

*Bioinformatician / Data Analyst*. Research and development of computational and
statistical methods for the study of Cancer Epigenetics. DNA Methylation 
microarrays and ChIP-seq data analysis. R/Bioconductor, BioPython, 
MACS, MAQ, BowTie and a lot of different and exciting stuff. I became 
quite aware of the problems around the Reproducibility of data analysis 
projects, specially in Science, and put into practice several 
virtualization solutions, literate programming and continuous integration 
techniques in order to ensure that previous results could be replicated by external 
independent reviewers. Additionally, I helped fellow members of the 
lab by providing experimental design and statistical support for 
their data analysis projects.

2011 - 2012 
: Arcelor Mittal

*Research Engineer*. As an external member of the KiN (Knowledge Innovation) 
group at the Technological Development Centre of Arcelor-Mittal, my work was 
focused on the design and development of optimization models for steel industry 
related problems. Research on logistics and metaheuristics. Main development
technologies were C# and Python.

2009 - 2010
:   Fundacion Prodintec

*Software Developer*. C++ and Matlab programming for a computer vision project
in collaboration with Metria Digital, S.L. The project's main goal was to develop
a custom solution to get repetitive three-dimensional measurements of
objects/parts/products in industrial manufacturing environments with the
accuracy and traceability required for quality control.

This innovative solution was based on a technology that allowed the
extraction of 3D coordinates of key points of the part to be measured from a
number of regular 2D images taken with conventional cameras. This system would
enable manufacturing companies to check their finished or semi-finished products
on-line, without interrupting the production processes.

2007 - 2008
:   European Centre for Soft Computing

*Postdoctoral Researcher*. As a member of the Cognitive Computing research unit,
I worked on the PSISBAN (Meanings Processing System for New Automated Bank 
Branches) project. PSISBAN was meant as the evolution of cash machines, adding
Meanings Processing during the communication with the client.

Thus, an empathetic environment would be created, adapting the cash machine to
the natural communication capacities of each person. Early prototypes, where
several artificial intelligence techniques were used, were developed in MATLAB
and Python.

2006 - 2006
:   Universidad de Oviedo

*Associate Professor*. Professor of subjects such as Operating Systems
Management, and Component Modeling, where technologies such as XML-RPC, Java RMI
and CORBA were being taught.

2006 - 2006
:   NEOTOP, S.L.

*R&D Consultant*. Technical advisor in a Computer Vision project on autonomous
road painting vehicles. Prototypes were developed in MATLAB and tested on real
environments.

2002 - 2006
:   Artificial Intelligence Centre, Universidad de Oviedo

*FPI Grant Researcher*. Machine learning research at the Artificial Intelligence
Centre. Specialized on feature subset selection methods on a preference learning
paradigm. Methods were prototyped in Python and later developed in C++ for
production.
